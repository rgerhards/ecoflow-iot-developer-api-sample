EcoFlow has released a cloud-base API for their units, called
the "EcoFlow IoT Develper Platform". This permits to query and set
parameters via an official API.

The API description is available at

    https://developer.ecoflow.com/us/document

Unfortunately, this doc is terse and lacks sample code. While trying
to understand the API, I have crafted some non-production sample code
on how to talk to many (but not all) API calls from python.

In it's current state, this code hopefully provides an idea of how
to utilize the API. It definitely needs to be modified for real 
production code.

Note: secret data is expected via environment variables. See the 
top of ecoflow.py to see what is needed. Note that only the
ECOFLOW* environment variables are needed - the rest is used
for my other applications.

I may improve the code as I use it for my own projects. No
promise, though. Suggestions for improvements are of course
welcome.

YOU NEED TO BE OWNER OF A SUPPORTED ECOFLOW UNIT TO USE THIS CODE!
